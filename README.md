# Whack-a-Male
Whack-a-Mole Game Developed with Android Studio

This is a small Whack-a-Mole game.

For the first 30 seconds, only one mole will appear at a time, showing up every 0.8 seconds.
After 30 seconds, two moles will appear simultaneously, but the frequency will change to once every 1 second.
You win the game if you score 500 points (each mole is worth 10 points).
